# Lore

This is the main lore page. Reading this will give you a good overview of the campaign setting. Only bother with the rest if you're actually interested.

## The Constructors
"Constructors" is the name given to an ancient precursor civilisation that mysteriously disappeared many millennia ago, leaving no trace besides their structures: elaborate temples to long forgotten gods, sprawling dungeon complexes of no clear purpose, towering pillars topped with eternal flames, and bizarre artefacts with unknown magical properties. These structures are abundant and almost perfectly persevered, showing almost no signs of the eons that have passed. The scale and engineering of these buildings is far beyond the capabilities of all subsequent societies. The constructors left behind no writing, no stories, no explanations, just tens of thousands of massive, empty structures.

## The Great Fracture
The fabric of magic itself on Elnne is torn. The two aspects of magic: Body and Mind have been separated. The Mind is believed to be the magic of souls, it effects the mental abilities of creatures. Mental magic can be controlled through practise and study, turned into spells and sorcery. It is the magic of civilisation and order. Body magic is physical, primal and less controllable. It is the magic of nature and chaos.

## Mirion and Ottria -- The Land of Empires
The region of the world consisting of the continent of Mirion and the islands of Ottria are generally referred to as the Eastern Empires, or sometimes as the lands of the Sun. This was the setting of my first two campaigns, and is home to the following major nations:
- The Ottrian Empire (Ottria)
- The Kolithian Republic (Kolith) *{Campaign 1}*
- The Shaelor Alliance (Shaelor) *{Campaign 2}*
- The Umbrex Confederation (Umbrex)
- The Stai Dynasty (Stai)

## Akion -- The Old World
Akion was once home to some of the greatest post-fracture civilisations in history, a seat of culture and technology. However, in the eras since, it has suffered a series of calamitous events that have left it shattered and chaotic. Officially united into the Kingdom of Averan, in practice Akion is divided up by squabbling princes, barons, and counts.
