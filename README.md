### The Fractured World
Elnne is the name of the world that my main two D&D campaigns at Nottingham took place in. It is defined by the [Great Fracture](Lore/Great%20Fracture.md), a cataclysmic event that wiped out the precursor civilisation known as the [Constructors](Lore/Constructors.md). This event was so catastrophic, it caused a rift in magic itself, splitting it into magic of the Body (physical) and Magic of the Soul (mental).

This wiki provides some high level background of the Lore of the world. This is mostly to provide some background for the upcoming campaign, but there is plenty of overlap with the prior two.

Head to the main [Lore](Lore.md) page to get started!
