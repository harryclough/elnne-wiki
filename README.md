## The Fractured World
Elnne is the name of the world that my main two D&D campaigns at Nottingham took place in. It is defined by the [Great Fracture](Lore/Great%20Fracture.md), a cataclysmic event that wiped out the precursor civilisation known as the [Constructors](Lore/Constructors.md). This event was so catastrophic, it caused a rift in magic itself, splitting it into magic of the Body (physical) and Magic of the Soul (mental).

## V3.0 Patch Notes (Retcons)
Ahead of my upcoming campaign, I am making some changes to the world. If you've played in my world before and taken an interest in the lore, you may notice some of these are pretty much retcons. These should almost exclusively affect the "high level" lore of the world, and so the actual content of the previous two campaigns is still canon.

This is only useful if you played in either of the first two campaigns. Otherwise, don't bother reading this section.

The major changes are as follows:
- **Continents** -- I don't know if it was ever explicit, but the size of the map has been scaled down. The world of campaigns 1 and 2 is now about the size of a continent (e.g. Africa), rather than being the entire world.
- **Akion / Averan** -- The continent of Akion, hosting the Kingdom of Averan, has been heavily changed. This region virtually did not feature at all in the first two campaign, but will likely be the setting of a future campaign.
- **Magic** -- Magic in the world is still fractured, but the fracture is now much more geographically random, rather than being North/South. Some regions experience little change, while others experience high and low periods over time. Parts of the world even experience magical storms or weirder phenomena.
